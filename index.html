            <p>Nature is an inherent character or constitution,[1] particularly of the ecosphere or the universe as a whole. In this general sense nature refers to the laws, elements and phenomena of the physical world, including life. Although humans are part of nature, human activity or humans as a whole are often described as at times at odds, or outright separate and even superior to nature.[2]</p>

            <p>At its core, conservation is the careful management and preservation of natural resources and the environment. It's a proactive approach to ensure that the wonders of our natural world - from vast forests to the tiniest insects - are safeguarded for future generations.</p>

            <p>Conservation is the act of preserving, guarding, or protecting - in the context of the environment, it means the sustainable use and management of natural resources, including wildlife, water, air, and earth deposits.</p>

                <p>HTML: As a web learner, I use HTML to structure the content of web pages. From creating simple text-based pages to embedding images, links, and forms, I am familiar with building the foundational layout of websites using clean and semantic HTML. This ensures that the content is well-organized and accessible.</p>
                <p>CSS: I leverage CSS to bring life to my HTML structures. Through styling, I can control the look and feel of the web pages by applying colors, fonts, layouts, and responsive designs. My experience includes working with flexbox, grid layouts, and media queries to create visually appealing and mobile-friendly web pages.</p>
